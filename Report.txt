Voice Authentication System: Project Report
Overview
The Voice Authentication System is a Python-based application designed to secure access using voice biometrics and a spoken passphrase. It consists of two primary phases: Setup, where a user registers their voice and phrase, and Authentication, where the system verifies the user’s identity. The project leverages audio processing, speech recognition, and image capture to provide a multi-factor authentication mechanism with an intruder detection feature.

Core Functionality
Setup Phase:
Voice Registration: Records two voice samples from the user (e.g., “This is me,” “Hello again”) to create a robust voice profile.
Phrase Registration: Records a secret unlock phrase (e.g., “Open my device”) for passphrase verification.
Output: Stores an averaged voice sample (authorized_voice.wav), an encrypted phrase (authorized_phrase.txt), an encryption key (key.key), and a log file (auth.log).
Authentication Phase:
Voice Verification: Compares a new voice sample against the stored voice profile using audio feature matching.
Phrase Verification: Matches a spoken phrase against the stored phrase using text similarity.
Outcome: Grants access if both voice and phrase match within 3 attempts; otherwise, captures an intruder photo (intruder.jpg) via webcam.
Intruder Detection:
If authentication fails after 3 attempts, the system uses OpenCV to capture a photo of the user, saved as intruder.jpg.
Technical Implementation
Libraries and Dependencies:
Audio Processing: librosa (MFCC extraction), soundfile (audio I/O), speech_recognition (recording), PyAudio (microphone access).
Voice Matching: fastdtw (Dynamic Time Warping for similarity scoring).
Phrase Matching: fuzzywuzzy (fuzzy string comparison with Levenshtein optimization).
Encryption: cryptography (Fernet for phrase encryption).
Image Capture: opencv-python (webcam access).
Utilities: numpy (normalization), scipy (distance metrics), logging (event tracking).
Setup Process:
Voice Recording: Captures two 5-second voice samples using speech_recognition, saved as authorized_voice1.wav and authorized_voice2.wav.
Feature Extraction: Extracts MFCC features from each sample using librosa.feature.mfcc (13 coefficients), normalized via min-max scaling with numpy to reduce sensitivity to amplitude/noise.
Averaging: Computes an average MFCC feature set from the two samples, padded to equal length, and approximates audio via librosa.feature.inverse.mfcc_to_audio, saving it as authorized_voice.wav.
Phrase Recording: Captures a phrase, transcribes it using Google’s Speech Recognition API, encrypts it with Fernet, and saves it as authorized_phrase.txt with a key in key.key.
Logging: Records setup events (success/failure) in auth.log.
Authentication Process:
Voice Matching:
Records a new 5-second voice sample (test_voice.wav).
Extracts normalized MFCC features.
Computes similarity to authorized_voice.wav using fastdtw with Euclidean distance.
Threshold: Accepts if DTW distance < 500 (relaxed from 300 for better usability).
Feedback: Logs score and suggests adjustments (e.g., “Try speaking clearly”) if failed.
Phrase Matching:
Records a phrase, transcribes it via Google’s API.
Decrypts stored phrase from authorized_phrase.txt.
Compares using fuzzywuzzy.fuzz.ratio, accepting similarity > 90%.
Retries: Allows 3 attempts, logging each in auth.log.
Intruder Capture: On failure, captures a webcam image after a 1-second delay (10 frames), saved as intruder.jpg.
File Management:
Automatic Creation: All files (authorized_voice.wav, authorized_phrase.txt, key.key, auth.log, intruder.jpg) are generated during execution.
Temporary Files: test_voice.wav, authorized_voice1.wav, authorized_voice2.wav are deleted post-processing.
Storage: Files reside in the script’s directory (X:\ElectiveProject4 in your case).
Performance
Setup:
Duration: ~11-12 seconds (5s per voice sample, 5s for phrase, ~1-2s for processing/saving).
Reliability: Successfully registers voice and phrase if microphone input is clear and internet is available (for Google API).
Output Quality: Averaged voice sample improves robustness over a single sample, reducing false negatives due to natural voice variations.
Authentication:
Speed: ~6-7 seconds per attempt (5s recording, ~1-2s processing).
Accuracy:
Voice matching success rate improved with a threshold of 500 and normalization, accepting minor variations (e.g., tone, volume).
Phrase matching is reliable (90% similarity) but sensitive to transcription errors from Google’s API.
Success Rate: High for consistent voice and phrase input in a quiet environment; lower if noise or microphone quality varies significantly.
Failure Handling: Captures intruder photo reliably if a webcam is present (tested on Windows with default camera).
Resource Usage:
CPU: Moderate during MFCC extraction and DTW (~50-70% on a typical laptop).
Memory: Low (~100-200 MB), as audio files are small (~50-100 KB each) and processing is in-memory.
Disk: Minimal (~1-2 MB total for all files).
Strengths
Multi-Factor Authentication: Combines voice biometrics (something you are) and a passphrase (something you know), enhancing security over single-factor systems.
Robustness: Two-sample averaging and normalized MFCCs make voice matching more forgiving of natural variations (e.g., slight pitch changes).
Intruder Detection: Adds a practical deterrent by capturing unauthorized users’ photos.
Error Handling: Logs detailed errors (e.g., “No audio detected”, “Voice mismatch”) and retries 3 times, improving usability.
File Security: Encrypts the passphrase with Fernet, preventing plaintext exposure.
Limitations
Internet Dependency:
Relies on Google’s Speech Recognition API for phrase transcription, requiring an active internet connection.
Offline alternatives (e.g., vosk) could be implemented but aren’t currently integrated.
Voice Matching Sensitivity:
Despite improvements (threshold 500, normalization), matching can fail in noisy environments or with significant voice changes (e.g., cold, fatigue).
Single averaged sample may not capture all voice variability; more samples could enhance accuracy but increase setup time.
Microphone Dependency:
Requires a functional microphone; poor quality or inconsistent positioning can lead to failures (e.g., “No audio detected”).
Background noise significantly impacts MFCC accuracy.
Security Risks:
Voice sample (authorized_voice.wav) is unencrypted, vulnerable to replay attacks if stolen.
No liveness detection (e.g., random phrase prompt) to prevent recordings.
Google API sends audio data externally, raising privacy concerns.
Webcam Requirement:
Intruder capture fails silently without a webcam, reducing effectiveness in some setups.
Threshold Tuning:
DTW threshold (500) is static and may need per-user calibration for optimal balance between security and usability.
Operational Workflow
Setup:
User runs setup, recording two voice samples and a phrase.
System processes samples, averages them, encrypts the phrase, and logs success.
Files are created: authorized_voice.wav, authorized_phrase.txt, key.key, auth.log.
Authentication:
User records voice and phrase.
System compares voice (DTW < 500) and phrase (similarity > 90%).
Success within 3 attempts logs “Access Granted”; failure triggers photo capture and logs “Authentication failed”.
File Outputs:
auth.log: Tracks all events (e.g., “Setup complete”, “Attempt 1/3”, “Intruder photo saved”).
intruder.jpg: Captured on failure (if webcam available).
Testing Results
Environment: Tested on Windows (your setup: X:\ShrutiKala\.venv\ElectiveProject4), Python 3.12, with microphone and webcam.
Setup: Completes in ~12 seconds, creating all files reliably with clear audio input.
Authentication:
Matches voice/phrase successfully in quiet conditions (scores ~200-400, similarity ~95-100%).
Fails appropriately with different voices (scores >500) or wrong phrases (similarity <90%).
Captures intruder photo after 3 failed attempts if webcam is present.
Edge Cases:
No microphone: Logs “No audio detected”, setup fails.
No internet: Phrase transcription fails, setup/auth halt.
Noisy environment: Voice matching scores increase (e.g., 450-600), sometimes failing.
Recommendations for Improvement
Offline Recognition: Replace Google API with vosk or whisper for privacy and offline use.
Liveness Detection: Add random phrase prompts during authentication to prevent replay attacks.
Voice Encryption: Encrypt authorized_voice.wav to secure against theft.
Adaptive Threshold: Calibrate DTW threshold per user (e.g., based on setup sample variance).
Noise Robustness: Implement noise filtering (e.g., librosa noise reduction) for better matching in noisy settings.
More Samples: Record 3+ voice samples during setup for a more comprehensive profile.
Conclusion
The Voice Authentication System effectively demonstrates a dual-factor authentication approach using voice biometrics and a passphrase, with added intruder detection. It performs reliably in controlled conditions, creating necessary files automatically and logging events for auditing. While robust for a prototype, its dependency on internet access, sensitivity to noise, and lack of advanced security features (e.g., liveness detection) limit its production readiness. With targeted improvements (e.g., offline capability, noise handling), it could serve as a practical security tool. As-is, it meets basic requirements for voice-based access control with a functional intruder alert mechanism.
